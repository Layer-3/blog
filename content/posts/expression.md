## Words {#words}

-   `mitigate`
    -   减轻

> One of the important goals of data center networks is to avoid or `mitigate` the effect of network bottlenecks on the operation of the computing services offered

-   `diversified`
    -   多变化的，各种的

> By using specialized optimization algorithms and `diversified` configuration options.

-   `seamless`
    -   smoothly and continuously, with no apparent gaps or spaces between one part and the next
    -   无缝衔接的，平滑的

> the load balancing service can take the appropriate actions to `seamlessly` distribute the traffic among the available servers.

-   `paramount`
    -   more important than anything else;
    -   至关重要的

> Another aspect of `paramount` importance is the portability of the programming language.

-   `Amenable` :
    -   willing to accept or be influenced by a suggestion;
    -   意为顺从的，愿意接受建议的，耳朵软的之类的意思。在 OpenFlow 一文中，作者将 Amenable 放在句首，来表达需要实现的功能。

> `Amenable` to high-performance and low-cost implementations.

-   `sophisticated`
    -   having a good understanding of the way people behave and/or a good knowledge of culture and fashion:
    -   intelligent or made in a complicated way and therefore able to do complicated tasks:
    -   意为复杂精巧的，精于世故的，精通的，富有经验的。此处来形容功能精细复杂的东西。

> One can also imagine more `sophisticated` controllers that dynamically add/remove ﬂows as an experiment progresses.

-   `envisage`
    -   to imagine or expect something in the future, especially something good;
    -   想象，设想，用来描述技术的前景

> One could `envisage` an extension to Ethane in which a policy dictates that particular ﬂows are sent to a user’s process in a controller, hence allowing researcher-speciﬁc processing to be performed in the network.

-   `inertia`
    -   lack of activity or interest, or unwillingness to make an effort to do anything
    -   惰性、惯性、懒惰。作者用来表述某个东西难以推动发展

> Due to the `inertia` of current IP networks, a new routing protocol can take five to ten years to be fully designed, evaluated, and deployed.

-   `alleviate`
    -   to make something bad such as pain or problems less severe
    -   减轻某种痛苦，减轻，缓和，使镇定

-   `proliferate`
    -   to increase a lot and suddenly in number
    -   激增、增殖，作者用来表达大量东西涌现，也就是激增的含义。

> To `alleviate` the lack of in-path functionalities within the network, a **myriad** of specialized components and middleboxes, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and deep packet inspection engines, `proliferate` in current networks.

-   `ubiquitous`
    -   seeming to be everywhere
    -   到处存在的

        > abstractions are essential tools of research in computer science and information technology, being already an `ubiquitous` feature of many computer architectures and systems.

-   `anchor`
    -   to lower an anchor into the water in order to stop a boat from moving away;
    -   to make something or someone stay in one position by fastening him, her, or it firmly;
    -   锚状物、固定、支撑，赖以支撑的人、物。作者用来表达一个技术依赖于一些东西（这些东西可以避免）

> However, these technologies are anchored on a box-by-box basis configuration.

-   `analogy`
    -   相似，类似，类比
    -   翻译说是举例来说，我感觉说是类比来看也可以：

> The base network service functions are what we consider the essential functionality all controllers should provide. `As an analogy`, these functions are like base services of operating systems, such as program execution, input/output (I/O) operations control, communications, protection, and so on.


## Sentences {#sentences}

-   `同时`

> for instance, allowing the distribution and directing of large groups of client requests without requiring controller intervention for every new flow. `In tandem`, operation in reactive mode may still be used when traffic bursts are detected.

-   `更不用说`

> Commercial switches and routers `do not` typically provide an open software platform, `let alone` provide a means to virtualize either their hardware or software.

-   `长期看来前景很不错` _（现在没啥用）_

> `This approach is promising in the long-term`, but for the time being is targeted at large switching centers and is too expensive for widespread deployment in college wiring closets.

-   `来满足`

> Programming languages can also provide specialized abstractions `to cope with` other management requirements, such as monitoring.


## Professional Expression {#professional-expression}

-   `fine-grained <==> coarser grained` 细粒度，粗粒度；
-   `race-free` 非竞争的；
-   `single point of failure`  单点故障；
-   `heterogeneity` 异质性；
-   `Wrapping Up Remarks` 总结，结束语；
-   `introduce` 引入，提出。


## Good Sentences {#good-sentences}

> The controller application **needs** to monitor the network traffic **and** use some sort of threshold **in** the flow counters **to** redistribute clients **among** the servers **when** bottlenecks are likely to happen.
